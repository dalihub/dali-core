# Build Instructions

## 1. Building for Ubuntu desktop

### Minimum Requirements

 - Ubuntu 14.04 or later

### Creating a DALi Environment

To build for desktop first ensure ALL sources are selected:
 - Go to Ubuntu Settings and then to "Software & Updates"
 - In the "Ubuntu Software" tab, ensure ALL software sources are ticked

(This is required because we install some community-maintained free & open-source software)

Then you can create a dali-env folder in your home folder with:

         $ dali-core/build/scripts/dali_env -c

This will also download any dependencies that the dali repositories require.

You can save the environment variables to a file:

         $ dali-env/opt/bin/dali_env -s > setenv

This process only needs to be done once.

Next source these variables:

         $ . setenv

You will have to source these variables every time you open up a new terminal (or you can add to .bashrc if you prefer).


### Building the Repository

To build the repository enter the 'build/tizen' folder:

         $ cd dali-core/build/tizen

Then run the following commands:

         $ autoreconf --install
         $ ./configure --prefix=$DESKTOP_PREFIX
         $ make install -j8

### Build target options

OpenGL ES context:

When building, the OpenGL ES version of the target should be specified.

Valid version options are 20, 30, 31

With configure:
Add: *--enable-gles=X*

With gbs:
Add to the gbs build line: *--define "%target_gles_version X"*


### Building and executing test cases

See the README.md in dali-core/automated-tests.

## 2. GBS Builds

### NON-SMACK Targets

         $ gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH]

### SMACK enabled Targets

         $ gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH] --define "%enable_dali_smack_rules 1"

### DEBUG Builds

         $ gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH] --define "%enable_debug 1"
