<H1>Naming</H1>
  <P>
    The most important consistency rules are those that govern
    naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of
    thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a
    constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the
    declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in our
    brains relies a great deal on these naming rules.
  </P>
  <P>
    Consistency is more important than individual preferences so regardless of
    whether you find them sensible or not, the rules are the rules.
  </P>

  <ARTICLE>
    <H2>General Naming Rules</H2>
      <SUMMARY>
        Function names, variable names, and filenames should be
        descriptive; eschew abbreviation.  Types and variables should be
        nouns, while functions should be "command" verbs.
      </SUMMARY>
      <H3>How to Name <input type="button" value="Hide" onclick="toggleVisibility( this, 'how_to_name' );"/></H3>
      <ARTICLE class="detail" id="how_to_name">
        <P>
          Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do
          not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more
          important to make your code immediately understandable by a
          new reader. Examples of well-chosen names:
        </P>
        <CODE class="good">
          int numberOfErrors;              // Good.
          int countCompletedConnections;   // Good.
        </CODE>
        <P>
          Poorly-chosen names use ambiguous abbreviations or arbitrary
          characters that do not convey meaning:
        </P>
        <CODE class="bad">
          int n;                           // Bad - meaningless.
          int nerr;                        // Bad - ambiguous abbreviation.
          int n_comp_conns;                // Bad - ambiguous abbreviation.
        </CODE>
        <P>
          Type and variable names should typically be nouns: e.g.,
          <code>FileOpener</code>,
          <code>NumErrors</code>.
        </P>
        <P>
          Function names should typically be imperative (that is they should be commands):
		  e.g., <code>OpenFile()</code>, <code>set_num_errors()</code>.  There is an exception for
          accessors, which should be named the same as the variable they access.
        </P>
      </ARTICLE>

      <H3>Abbreviations <input type="button" value="Hide" onclick="toggleVisibility( this, 'abbreviations' );"/></H3>
      <ARTICLE class="detail" id="abbreviations">
        <P>
          Do not use abbreviations unless they are extremely well
          known outside your project. For example:
        </P>
        <CODE class="good">
          // Good
          // These show proper names with no abbreviations.
          int numberOfDnsConnections;  // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
          int priceCountReader;   // OK, price count. Makes sense.
        </CODE>
        <CODE class="bad">
          // Bad!
          // Abbreviations can be confusing or ambiguous outside a small group.
          int wgcconnections;  // Only your group knows what this stands for.
          int pcreader;        // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
        </CODE>
        <P>
          Never abbreviate by leaving out letters:
        </P>
        <CODE class="good">
          int error_count;  // Good.
        </CODE>
        <CODE class="bad">
          int error_cnt;    // Bad.

    <H2>File Names</H2>
    <SUMMARY>
      Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores dashes (<code>-</code>).
      Do not use underscores in filenames (<code>_</code>).
    </SUMMARY>
    <H3>Examples <input type="button" value="Hide" onclick="toggleVisibility( this, 'file_name_examples' );"/></H3>
    <ARTICLE class="detail" id="file_name_examples">
      <P>
        Examples of acceptable file names:
      </P>
      <P>
        <CODE class="good">
          my-useful-class.cpp
          myusefulclass.cpp
          myusefulclass-test.cpp
        </CODE>
      </P>
      <P>
        C++ files should end in <code>.cpp</code> and header files
        should end in <code>.h</code>.
      </P>
      <P>
        Do not use filenames that already exist
        in <code>/usr/include</code>, such as <code>db.h</code>.
      </P>
      <P>
        In general, make your filenames very specific.  For example,
        use <code>http-server-logs.h</code> rather than <code>logs.h</code>.
		A class called <code>FooBar</code> should be declared in file
		called <code>foobar.h</code> and defined in <code>foobar.cpp</code>.
      </P>
      <P>
        Inline functions must be in a <code>.h</code> file. If your
        inline functions are very short, they should go directly into your
        <code>.h</code> file. However, if your inline functions
        include a lot of code, they may go into a third file that
        ends in <code>-inl.h</code>.  In a class with a lot of inline
        code, your class could have three files:
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
        foobar.h      // The class declaration.
        foobar.cpp     // The class definition.
        foobar-inl.h  // Inline functions that include lots of code.

  <ARTICLE>
    <H2>Type Names</H2>
    <SUMMARY>
      Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital
      letter for each new word, with no underscores:
      <code>MyExcitingClass</code>, <code>MyExcitingEnum</code>.
      All type names are declared inside a namespace so no prefixing is used.
    </SUMMARY>
    <H3>Examples <input type="button" value="Hide" onclick="toggleVisibility( this, 'type_name_examples' );"/></H3>
    <ARTICLE class="detail" id="type_name_examples">
      <p>
        The names of all types; classes, structs, typedefs have the same naming convention -
        CamelCase with a leading capital letter, with no underscores. Enumerated type constants use the same convention as class constants, i.e. all uppercase with underscores.
        For example:
      </p>
      <CODE class="good">
        // classes and structs
        class UrlTable { ... };
        class UrlTableTester { ... };
        struct UrlTableProperties { ... };

        // typedefs
        typedef hash_map<UrlTableProperties *, string> PropertiesMap;

        // enums
        enum UrlTableErrors
        {
          OK = 0,
          OUT_OF_MEMORY = 1,

  </ARTICLE>

  <ARTICLE>
    <H2>Variable Names</H2>
    <SUMMARY>
      Variable names should use camel case, with an initial lower case letter.
      Local variable names start with a lowercase letter. For example: <code>myExcitingLocalVariable</code>,
      Class member variables have prefix m. For example: <code>mMember</code>.
      The only exception to this rule is for public member variables in public structs where the prefix m is not required.
      Such member variables should also start with a lowercase letter.
      Avoid underscore characters in mixed case names.
      Constants should be all upper case, with underscores between words.
      Global variables should be avoided, however, if one is needed, prefix it with <code>g</code>.

    <H2>Function Names</H2>

    <H2>Macro Names</H2>
    <SUMMARY>
      Macros should not be used for programming, code should always be readable without preprocessor.
      Only allowed cases for macros are include guards, debug tracing and compile time feature flags
      <b>inside</b> .cpp files when no other variation mechanism is not possible. Always prefer variation
      through design and template mechanisms rather than <i>#define</i>.
      If you need to use macros, they're like this: <code>MY_MACRO_THAT_SCARES_SMALL_CHILDREN</code>.

<H1>Comments</H1>
  <SUMMARY>
    Comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable.
    The following rules describe what you should comment and where.
    But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is self-documenting.
    Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better than using obscure
    names that you must then explain through comments.
    When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next
    contributor who will need to understand your code.

  <H2>Comment Rules <input type="button" value="Hide" onclick="toggleVisibility( this, 'comments_details' );"/></H2>
  <ARTICLE class="detail" id="comments_details">
    <H3>Comment Style</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        API documentation must use doxygen comments:   /** */ or /// <BR>
        Internal comments can use <CODE>//</CODE> or <CODE>/* */</CODE> syntax, as long
        as you are consistent.
      </SUMMARY>
    <H3>File Comments</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Start each header file with a guard macro.<BR>
        This should match the name of the class which is defined in the file,
        including the namespace.<BR>
        For example, a class in the Dali namespace called Actor would have the guard:<BR><BR> __DALI_ACTOR_H__<BR><BR>
        An Actor class in the Dali::Internal namespace would have the guard:<BR><BR> __DALI_INTERNAL_ACTOR_H__<BR><BR>
        The copyright & legal notice should follow the guard macro (inside the #ifdef), since this will improve build times.<BR><BR>
        Start each source file with the copyright & legal notice.
      </SUMMARY>
    <H3>Class Comments</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Every class definition should have an accompanying comment that
        describes what it is for and how it should be used. It should have
        a brief description, followed by a newline and a broader description.

        Document the synchronization assumptions the class makes, if
        any. If an instance of the class can be accessed by multiple
        threads, take extra care to document the rules and invariants
        surrounding multithreaded use.
      </P>
    <H3>Function Comments</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Every function declaration in a header file must have a brief comment
        that describes what the function does, followed by a newline. It may
        be followed by a detailed description on how to use it.
        These comments should be descriptive ("Opens the file") rather than
        imperative ("Open the file"); the
        comment describes the function, it does not tell the function what to do.
        Each parameter must be documented, as must any return value.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        Types of things to mention in comments at the function
        declaration:

        <LI> For class member functions:  whether the object
              remembers reference arguments beyond the
              duration of the method call, and whether it will
              free them or not. </LI>
        <LI> If the function allocates memory that the caller
              must free. </LI>
        <LI> Whether any of the arguments can be <CODE>NULL</CODE> </LI>
        <LI> If there are any performance implications of how a function is used.</LI>

          When commenting constructors and destructors, remember that
          the person reading your code knows what constructors and
          destructors are for, so comments that just say something like
          "destroys this object" are not useful.

    <H3>Variable Comments</H3>

        In general the actual name of the variable should be descriptive

    <SUMMARY>
        Try to avoid duplicate documentation by using the @copydoc command.
    </SUMMARY>
    <P>
       @copydoc copies a documentation block from the object specified by
       link-object and pastes it at the location of the command.
       This command can be useful to avoid cases where a documentation block
       would otherwise have to be duplicated or it can be used to extend the
       documentation of an inherited member.

      * More documentation.

    <H3>Punctuation, Spelling and Grammar</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is
        easier to read well-written comments than badly written ones.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        Comments should usually be written as complete
        sentences with proper capitalization and periods at the end.
        Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of
        code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be
        consistent with your style.  Complete sentences are more
        readable, and they provide some assurance that the comment is
        complete and not an unfinished thought.
      </P>
    <H3>TODO Comments</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Use <code>TODO</code> comments for code that is temporary, a
        short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.
      </SUMMARY>
    <H3>Deprecation Comments</H3>

        Mark deprecated interface points with <code>@deprecated</code> comments.

        On one line if it fits; otherwise, wrap arguments at the parenthesis. Put one space inside the parentheses, none outside.

        <P>
          If the arguments do not all fit on one line, they should be

    <H3>Conditionals</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        The <code>if</code> statement should be followed only by the conditional, with a space inside the parentheses, not outside. The following clause must always be surrounded by braces on separate lines.
        The <code>else</code> keyword belongs on its own line, and the following clause must always be
        surrounded by braces.
      </SUMMARY>
      <CODE class="good">

        {

      <P>
        Must always have curly braces for the clauses, and they must always be on a line
        on their own:

    <H3>Loops and Switch Statements</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Switch statements use braces for blocks. Empty loop bodies must use
        <code>{}</code> or <code>continue</code>.
        Switch statements should always have a <code>default</code> case
        unless they switch on an <code>enum</code> type,
        for which the compiler will ensure all values are handled.

        If the default case should never execute, simply <code>assert</code>.
        Put one space inside the parentheses, none outside.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        <code>case</code> blocks in <code>switch</code> statements must have
        curly braces.
        They should be placed as shown below.
      </P>

      <CODE class="good">
        switch( var )
        {
          case 0: // 2 space indent
          {
            ...      // 2 space indent
            break;
          }
          case 1:
          {
            ...
            break;
          }
          default:
          {
            DALI_ASSERT_ALWAYS( false );
          }
        }
      </CODE>
      <P>
        Empty loop bodies should use <code>{}</code> or
        <code>continue</code>, but not a single semicolon.
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
        while( condition )
        {
          // Repeat test until it returns false.
        }

        for( int i = 0; i < someNumber; ++i )
        {
        }  // Good - empty body, clearly separated.

        while( condition )
          continue;  // Good - continue indicates no logic.

      </CODE>
      <CODE class="bad">
        while( condition );  // Bad - looks like part of do/while loop.

    <H3>Pointer and Reference Expressions</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        No spaces around period or arrow.  Pointer operators do not have trailing spaces.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        The following are examples of correctly-formatted pointer and
        reference expressions:
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
        x = *p;
        p = &amp;x;
        x = r.y;
        x = r-&gt;y;
      </CODE>
      <P>
        When declaring a pointer variable or argument, you may place
        the asterisk adjacent to either the type or to the variable
        name, however, placing with the type is preferred.
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
        // These are fine, space preceding.
        char *c;
        const string &amp;str;

        // These are fine, space following.
        char* c;    // but remember to do each variable on its own line or "char* c, *d, *e, ...;"!
        const string&amp; str;
      </CODE>
      <CODE class="bad">
        char * c;  // Bad - spaces on both sides of *
        const string &amp; str;  // Bad - spaces on both sides of &amp;
      </CODE>
      <P>
        You should do this consistently within a single file,
        so, when modifying an existing file, use the style in that file.
      </P>

    <H3>Boolean Expressions</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        When you have a boolean expression that is long, be consistent in
        how you break up the lines.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        In this example, the logical AND operator is always at the end
        of the lines:
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
        if( thisOneThing &gt; thisOtherThing &amp;&amp;
            aThirdThing == aFourthThing &amp;&amp;
            yetAnother &amp;&amp; lastOne )
        {
          ...
        }
      </CODE>

    <H3>Return Values</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Do not needlessly surround the <code>return</code> expression with parentheses.
      </SUMMARY>
      <CODE class="good">
        return result;                   // No parentheses in the simple case.
        return ( someLongCondition &amp;&amp;    // Parentheses ok to make a complex

    <H3>Variable and Array Initialization</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Your choice of <code>=</code> or <code>()</code>.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        You may choose between <code>=</code> and <code>()</code>; the
        following are all correct:
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
        int x = 3;
        int x( 3 );
        string name( "Some Name" );
        string name = "Some Name";
      </CODE>

    <H3>Preprocessor Directives</H3>
      <SUMMARY>
        Preprocessor directives should not be indented but should
        instead start at the beginning of the line.
      </SUMMARY>
      <P>
        Even when pre-processor directives are within the body of
        indented code, the directives should start at the beginning of
        the line.
      </P>
      <CODE class="good">
