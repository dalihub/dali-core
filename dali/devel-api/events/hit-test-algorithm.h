/**
 * @brief This namespace is provided for application developers to do hit-test for the actors.
 *
 * <h3>Hit Test Algorithm:</h3>
 *
 * Hit testing is dependent on the camera used, which is specific to each RenderTask. For each RenderTask,
 * hit testing starts from the top-most layer and we go through all the layers until we have a hit or there
 * are none left. Before we perform a hit test within a layer, we check if all the layer's parents meet the
 * conditions defined by the function ((e.g. whether it is visible)). If they are not, we skip hit testing
 * the actors in that layer altogether. Otherwise, we walk through the actor tree within a layer to check
 * whether the actors within the actor tree should be hit-tested.
 *
 * The following pseudocode gives an example of what the function can typically check, which should normally
 * be provided by the application code:
 *
 *   @code
 *   HIT-TEST-FUNCTION( ACTOR, TRAVERSE-TYPE )
 *   {
 *     if( TRAVERSE-TYPE == CHECK_ACTOR ) // Check whether current actor should be hit-tested
 *     {
 *       if( ACTOR-IS-VISIBLE &&
 *           ACTOR-WORLD-COLOR-IS-NOT-TRANSPARENT )
 *       {
 *         HITTABLE = TRUE
 *       }
 *     }
 *     else if( TRAVERSE-TYPE == DESCEND_ACTOR_TREE ) ///< Check whether the actor tree should be descended to hit-test its children.
 *     {
 *       if( ACTOR-IS-VISIBLE )
 *       {
 *         HITTABLE = TRUE
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *   @endcode
 *
 * The following pseudocode explains how the algorithm performs the hit-test with the above functor:
 *
 *   @code
 *   HIT-TEST-WITHIN-LAYER( ACTOR )
 *   {
 *     // Depth-first traversal within current layer, visiting parent first
 *
 *     // Check whether current actor should be hit-tested
 *     IF ( HIT-TEST-FUNCTION( ACTOR, CHECK_ACTOR ) &&
 *          ACTOR-HAS-NON-ZERO-SIZE )
 *     {
 *       // Hit-test current actor
 *       IF ( ACTOR-HIT )
 *       {
 *         IF ( DISTANCE-TO-ACTOR < DISTANCE-TO-LAST-HIT-ACTOR )
 *         {
 *           // The current actor is the closest actor that was underneath the touch
 *           LAST-HIT-ACTOR = CURRENT-ACTOR
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     // Keep checking children, in case we hit something closer
 *     FOR-EACH CHILD (in order)
 *     {
 *       IF ( HIT-TEST-FUNCTION( ACTOR, DESCEND_ACTOR_TREE ) &&
 *            ACTOR-IS-NOT-A-LAYER )
 *       {
 *         // Continue traversal for this child's sub-tree
 *         HIT-TEST-WITHIN-LAYER ( CHILD )
 *       }
 *       // else we skip the sub-tree with from this child
 *     }
 *   }
 *   @endcode
