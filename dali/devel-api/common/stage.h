/**
 * @brief The Stage is a top-level object used for displaying a tree of Actors.
 *
 * Stage is a top-level object that represents the entire screen.
 * It is used for displaying a hierarchy of actors managed by the scene graph structure,
 * which means an actor inherits a position relative to its parent,
 * and can be moved in relation to this point.
 *
 * The stage instance is a singleton object (the only instance of its class during the
 * lifetime of the program). You can get it using a static function.
 *
 * To display the contents of an actor, it must be added to a stage.
 * The following example shows how to connect a new actor to the stage:
 * @code
 * Actor actor = Actor::New();
 * Stage::GetCurrent().Add( actor );
 * @endcode
 *
 * The stage has a 2D size that matches the size of the application window.
 * The default unit 1 is 1 pixel with the default camera.
 *
 * Multiple stage/window support is not currently provided.
