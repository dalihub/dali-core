 * @brief Generate a distance field map from a source image.

 * @param[in]  imagePixels     A pointer to a buffer containing the source image
 * @param[in]  imageSize       The size, width and height, of the source image
 * @param[out] distanceMap     A pointer to a buffer to receive the calculated distance field map.
 *                             Note: This must not overlap with imagePixels for correct distance field map generation.
 * @param[in]  distanceMapSize The size, width and height, of the distance field map
 * @param[in]  fieldBorder     The amount of distance field cells to add around the data (for glow/shadow effects)
 * @param[in]  maxSize         The image is scaled from this size to distanceMapSize
 * @param[in]  highQuality     Set true to generate high quality distance fields
