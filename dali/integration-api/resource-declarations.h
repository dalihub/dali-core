/**
 * @brief Used to identify a resource loading operation.
 *
 * These unique ResourceId values can be used to identify a resource loading
 * transaction in core-adaptor communication.
 * A resource transaction is asynchronous and many can be in-flight
 * concurrently.
 * A ResourceId allows the core to track a resource transaction over its
 * lifetime and match an asynchronous completion notification to the
 * corresponding load request or to cancel the operation early.
 *
 * A resource transaction begins with a call to PlatformAbstraction::LoadResource()
 * Later asynchronous status notifications obtained by polling
 * PlatformAbstraction::GetResources() can be mapped to corresponding
 * LoadResource() invocations using the ResourceId value.
 * It is the core's responsibility to ensure that each invocation of
 * PlatformAbstraction::LoadResource() passes in a Request object with a unique
 * integer ResourceId.
