/**
 * The LocklessBuffer class implements double buffering eligible for multi-(two) threaded use,
 * where it's possible to read from one thread and write from another
 * without requiring a mutex lock to avoid performance hit.
 * It's intended to be used for reading bitmap data in render thread
 * while still possible to write data in another thread.
 *
 * Ideally Write() and Read() calls should be alternating, otherwise written data might be thrown away.
 *
 * The buffers are swapped in the reading thread, just before reading begins.
 * In case the other thread is writing at that moment, buffers are not swapped and previously available data is read.
 * Similarly if Write() is called before a Read() has finished the previous write buffer is overwritten.
