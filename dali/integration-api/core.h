/**
 * Integration::Core is used for integration with the native windowing system.
 * The following integration tasks must be completed:
 *
 * 1) Handle Graphics API
 *
 * 2) Provide suspend/resume behaviour (see below for more details).
 *
 * 3) Run an event loop, for passing events to the Core e.g. multi-touch input events.
 * Notification events should be sent after a frame is updated (see UpdateStatus).
 *
 * 4) Run an animation loop, instructing the Core to process scene graph, animation and constraints
 * A separate update thread is recommended; see multi-threading options below.
 *
 * 5) Provide an implementation of the PlatformAbstraction interface, used to access platform specific services.
 *
 * 6) Provide an implementation of the GestureManager interface, used to register gestures provided by the platform.
 *
 * Multi-threading notes:
 *
 * The Dali API methods are not reentrant.  If you access the API from multiple threads simultaneously, then
 * the results are undefined. This means that your application might segfault, or behave unpredictably.
 *
 * Rendering strategies:
 *
 * 1) Single-threaded. Call every Core method from the same thread. Event handling and animation will occur in
 * the same thread.  This is not recommended, since processing input (slowly) can affect the smooth flow of
 * animations.
 *
 * 2) Multi-threaded. The Core update operation can be processed in a separate thread.
 * See the method description in Core to see which thread it should be called from.
 * This is the recommended option, so that input processing will not affect the smoothness of animations.
