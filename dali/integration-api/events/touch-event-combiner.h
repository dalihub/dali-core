 * Dali::Integration::TouchEventCombiner is a utility class, an instance of which, should be created
 * upon initialisation.  It accepts single Point(s) containing information about a touch area and
 * creates a TouchEvent and/or HoverEvent combining the latest event's information with previous Point(s).
 *
 * The created TouchEvent and/or HoverEvent can then be sent to the Dali Core as indicated by the GetNextTouchEvent()
 * method.
 *
 * The TouchEventCombiner ensures that the following rules are also adhered to:
 * - If two Down events are accidentally received, then the second one is ignored.
 * - Motion events are not processed if a Down event does not precede it.
 * - Motion event throttling is carried out to satisfy the minimum distance and time delta required.
 * - If an interrupted event is received, then any stored Point history is cleared.
