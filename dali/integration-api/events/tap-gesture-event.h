 * If the adaptor detects a tap gesture, then it should create an instance of this structure and

 * - Possible:  When the user first puts their finger down - Core needs to hit test the down point so
 *              that a tap (down and up quickly) is also on the same actor.
 * - Started:   If a tap is detected (No Finished state is expected).
 * - Cancelled: If, after a down event, no tap is detected, or a system interruption.
 *
 * A Started state will be ignored if a Possible state does not precede it.
