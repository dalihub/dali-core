 * If the adaptor detects a pan gesture, then it should create an instance of this structure and

 * A Pan Gesture event should be in one of five states:
 * - POSSIBLE:   When the user first puts their finger down - Core needs to hit test the down point.
 * - STARTED:    If a pan is detected.
 * - CONTINUING: If after a pan is detected, it continues.
 * - FINISHED:   If after a pan, the user lifts their finger(s).
 * - CANCELLED:  If, after a down event, no pan is detected or a system interruption.
 *
 * A STARTED state will be ignored if a POSSIBLE state does not precede it.
 * Likewise, a CONTINUING or FINISHED state will be ignored if a STARTED state does not precede it.
