/**
 * @brief LinearConstrainer applies constraints to objects, given a linear map.
 *
 * A linear map is defined by a set of value-progress pairs.
 * Progress must be normalized between [0,1]. If no progress is defined, the values
 * are considered to be equally spaced along the X axis.
 *
 * Basically, a linear constrainer allows constraining a property to another property
 * with the changes mapped over a certain range. For example, if you want to change the
 * opacity of an actor depending on its position along the X-axis, so that it's fully
 * transparent on the edges and fully opaque in the center. To do this, an array with
 * values, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, is created, which means that there are 3 control points.
 * You can add as many control points as you want, but they will be linearly spaced.
 * Then you can apply the linear constrainer by using the alpha of the actor as the
 * target and the source as the actor's position.
