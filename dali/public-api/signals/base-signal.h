/**
 * @brief Implementation class for Dali::Signal.
 *
 * A slot can be connected to many signals
 * A signal can be connected to many slots
 *
 * To provide automatic disconnection when either a signal or the object owning the slot dies,
 * observers are used.
 *
 * A signal is an object with state. It holds a list of SignalConnection%s.
 *
 * E.g.
 *  Signal OnTouch. mSignalConnections contains
 * <table>
 * <tr><td> %Callback 0 </td><td> Signal Observer 0  </td></tr>
 * <tr><td> %Callback 1 </td><td> Signal Observer 1  </td></tr>
 * <tr><td> %Callback 2 </td><td> Signal Observer 2  </td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * OnTouch.Emit() will run callbacks 0, 1 and 2.
 *
 * When the signal is destroyed. SignalDisconnected() is called on each Signal Observer.
 *
 * Slots are just static or member functions, so have no state. E.g. they can't keep
 * track of how many signals they are connected to.
 * If the object owning a slot dies, it must automatically disconnected from all signals.
 * If it doesn't disconnect and the signal is emitted, there will be a crash.
 *
 * To keep track of connections between slots and signals, a Connection tracker is used.
 * It holds a list of SlotConnections.
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr><td> %Callback 0 </td><td> Slot Observer 0  </td></tr>
 * <tr><td> %Callback 1 </td><td> Slot Observer 1  </td></tr>
 * <tr><td> %Callback 2 </td><td> Slot Observer 2  </td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * When the connection tracker is destroyed, SlotDisconnected() is called on every slot observer ( signal ).
 * Signals implement the Slot Observer interface, to be told when a slot has disconnected.
 * Connection tracker implements the Signal Observer interface, to be told when a signal has disconnected (died).
