 * @brief An invariant concurrent assertion to ensure its argument always evaluates TRUE.

 * To be clear, this test remains compiled into release builds that are deployed
 * on the platform.
 * Semantically, a failure of this test is signalling that dali is giving up and
 * quitting.
 * Since we don't catch the exception, a failure on any thread other than event
 * will propagate up the call stack and kill that thread.
 * A failure on the event thread may give the application an opportunity to
 * recover if there is an application-written exception handler on the call
 * stack between the throw site and the thread root and the application is built
 * with a compatible ABI.
 * Handle this macro with care at the level you would if it expanded to:
 *    if(!cond) { exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }
 * (which it is often equivalent to in effect).
 * It should not be used for simple parameter validation for instance.
