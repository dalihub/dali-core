/**
 * @brief Layers provide a mechanism for overlaying groups of actors on top of each other.
 *
 * When added to the stage, a layer can be ordered relative to other
 * layers. The bottom layer is at depth zero. The stage provides a default
 * layer for it's children (see Stage::GetRootLayer()).
 *
 * Layered actors inherit position etc. as normal, but are drawn in an order
 * determined by the layers. In case of LAYER_3D, the depth buffer is cleared
 * before each layer is rendered unless depth test is disabled or there's no
 * need for it based on the layer's contents; actors in lower layers cannot
 * obscure actors in higher layers.
 *
 * A layer has either LAYER_2D or LAYER_3D mode. LAYER_2D has better
 * performance, the depth test is disabled, and a child actor hides its
 * parent actor.  LAYER_3D uses the depth test, thus a close actor hides a
 * farther one.  LAYER_2D is the default mode and recommended for general
 * cases.  See Layer::Behavior and SetBehavior() for more information.
 *
 * Layer is a type of Actor, thus can have parent or children actors.  A
 * layer influences rendering of its all descendant actors, until another
 * layer appears in the actor tree and manages its own subtree.
 *
 * If depth test is disabled, there is no performance overhead from clearing
 * the depth buffer.
