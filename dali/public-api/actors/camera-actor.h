/**
 * @brief CameraActor controls a camera.
 *
 * Allows the developer to use actor semantics to control a camera.
 *
 * DALi has a concept of a camera to display its virtual 3D world to a 2D screen.
 * There are 2 ways of using the camera in DALi:
 *
 * - For 2D applications, you do not need to care about the camera at all. The default camera is already best suited for 2D applications
 *   (configured to have the origin of the coordinate system at the top-left corner of the screen, and unit 1 as 1 pixel of the screen).
 *   This is a typical way.
 *
 * - For 3D applications, you can change the view by manipulating the camera. You can translate or rotate the camera in this case.
 *   Note that the top-left corner of the screen and unit 1 no longer are (0,0,0) and 1 pixel after manipulating the camera.
 *
 * There are two types of camera actor, FREE_LOOK and LOOK_AT_TARGET. By default,
 * the camera actor will be FREE_LOOK.
 *
 * - A FREE_LOOK camera uses actor's orientation to control where the camera is looking.
 *   If no additional rotations are specified, the camera looks in the negative Z direction.
 *
 * - For LOOK_AT_TARGET, the actor's orientation is ignored, instead the camera looks at TARGET_POSITION
 *   in world coordinates.
